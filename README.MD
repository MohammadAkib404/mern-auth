# MERN Authentication App
A complete authentication system with signup, login, email verification, and password reset built using React (frontend) and Node.js + Express + MongoDB (backend).

## Note
This project was originally developed locally as a part of my early backend learning journey. I followed a tutorial by (GreatStack) to understand how backend architecture, authentication, and database handling work in practice. Some commits might not be structured as expected.

## Features
